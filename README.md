## ✨ About the Project

This is **my first project using Python and MySQL** — a simple console-based Chemist Shop Management System. 
It simulates the basic functionality of a real medical store, allowing medicine inventory and billing operations via terminal.


Through this project, I learned how to:
- Connect Python with a MySQL database
- Perform SQL operations from Python
- Structure backend logic using functions and menus

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 CAPTCHA-style login to simulate basic verification
- 📦 Add new medicines with full details (name, manufacturer, expiry date, etc.)
- 🔍 Search medicines by ID
- 🔁 Restock existing medicines
- ❌ Delete medicine records
- 🧾 Generate bills for customers with total calculation
- 📄 View past bills stored in the database
- 💾 All data is stored using a MySQL database for persistence

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. On launch, the system displays a **random number verification** to simulate a login.
2. Once verified, a **menu-based interface** allows users to:
   - Add, update, delete, or search medicine records
   - Generate bills and save customer data
   - View all previous bills
3. All actions perform **real-time CRUD operations** on the MySQL database named `medicine_shop`.

 The program uses a menu-driven interface to manage medicines and billing, storing all data in a MySQL database with real-time CRUD operations.
